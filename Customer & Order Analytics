In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY Price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenu
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) as Customers, AVG(quantity*price) as Average_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales February
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON February.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE February.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;


-Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT DISTINCT Location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >=3;


--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity) as Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT AVG(quantity*price) as Average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales February
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Customers
ON February.orderID = Customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT SUM(quantity)/count(Customers.acctnum) as Average_quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as February
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as Customers
ON February.orderid = Customers.order_id
WHERE length(OrderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
